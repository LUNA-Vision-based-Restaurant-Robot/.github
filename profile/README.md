**Robot LUNA** is a state-of-the-art restaurant waiter robot, designed with a focus on stability and precision. It is equipped with a dual camera setup, including an HD wide-angle camera and a Kinect-2 depth camera, enabling vision-based navigation in a 3D restaurant environment grid. The robot's enhanced stability ensures the safe delivery of food and drinks without spillage, even during braking, thanks to a dedicated stabilization tray circuit LUNA will ensure safety. Internally, LUNA has three Raspberry Pis for separate parallel processing tasks and is connected to custom PCB based on Atmega2560 to get stable and accurate sensor and encoder readings, and to control motor drivers accurately. Externally it communicates with a Restaurant's local server computer with ROS 1 Noetic through the local wifi network ensuring precise navigation path and food order locations based on the restaurant tables. This combination of advanced technology and innovative design makes LUNA a reliable and efficient addition to any restaurant staff.
